Real-Time Video Streaming using Socket Programming

## Description:

This project involves creating a Python-based real-time video streaming system using TCP. The server streams video content to multiple clients, while each client features a GUI displaying video thumbnails. Users can select and play videos in real-time, with the server handling client connections and requests via socket programming. The server uses OpenCV for video handling, and client-side interactions are managed with a Tkinter-based interface. The system provides reliable, ordered video delivery and supports simultaneous connections, ensuring smooth streaming.
