Real-Time Video Streaming using Socket Programming

## Description:

Python-based multimedia streaming system where the server streams video content to multiple clients using UDP for real-time transmission. The client application will feature a GUI displaying thumbnails of available videos, allowing users to select and play videos in real-time. The server will log client connections and requests using socket programming. I plan to use OpenCV for video handling and a library like Tkinter for the interface depending on the requirements.
